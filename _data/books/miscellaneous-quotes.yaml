- text: Radical politics is about the abstract because it's trying to draft a world that's not yet quite real - a future world, a fairer world, a better world, a different world.

- text: No one is going to save this stuff but all of us. There is no path in the capitalist system to preserve games in a way that will please the legal fetishists.
