One may dye their hair green and wear their grandma's coat all they want. Capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself. Even those who would *critique* capital end up *reinforcing* it instead...

He is starting to suspect that Kras Masov "fucked him over" personally with his socio-economic theory. It has, however, made him into a very, very smart boy with something like a university degree in truth. Instead of building Communism, he now builds a precise model of this grotesque, duplicitous world.

You can expect your coordination and balance to improve in a couple of weeks. In two months, you might start sleeping like a normal person. Full recovery will take years, though. It'll be depressing. And it'll be boring. Don't expect any rewards of handclaps. This is how normal people are all the time.

I NEED YOU. YOU CAN KEEP ME ON THIS EARTH. BE VIGILANT. I LOVE YOU."

- text: It's what this Soona person is looking for, and trying to measure. It'll be fruitless though. She won't be able to measure it. People like that always want to measure everything, all those things they really can't. You can't measure shit like this... it's not like... with substance.

- text: I saw some piglets suckling their dead mother. After a short while they shuddered and went away. They had sensed that she could no longer see them and that she wasn't like them any more. What they loved in their mother wasn't her body, but whatever it was that made her body live.

- text: Humanism leads to eating sugar and pigs. Humanism was invented to mass produce billions of humans. Billions of humans can mass produce *hundreds* of billions of pigs. She liked games. Her legacy, the thing we're living, isn't *real* life. It's a strategy for some kind of victory. Against a long dead opponent.

- text: "\"What are you suspicious of?\"
  \"Oh, it'd be easier to list stuff I'm not suspicious of. I'm not suspicious of sound and colour. Mechanics and chemistry also have a trueness about them. Most anything else decieves. Wants to steal your life away.\""

- text: "\"What's suspicious about pork and wheat?\" \"It's our only shit. We should make better use of not being animals -- or cereal grains -- ourselves. Having food is a means to an end. But the left never talks about the end, only the means. Caps are likewise suckers, constantly sleepless in worry.\"

\"Their (The left and right) movement's only concern is producing enough pig and wheat for everyone -- the end goal of humanity. The original mistake was assuming that words have more being than bodies. That's what lead us astray, far from our true lives. But we may yet find a way back.\""

- text: You mentioned *true life*. What would that be like? "A life is true if it's free from fear and internal division among oneself. And others -- mankind has seeds of greatness in it. A germinal will come, a return to trueness. It will be hard core. Beats and bright lights will shatter falsehoods. Never impulses for the collective body. We are very much alike in basic structure. A hard enough beat would awaken everyone to a truer calling -- in unity! Hard core is utmost dedication. Thoughts from the spinal cord. It's a potent superlative as well. Maybe you're confused because you're being too specific about it? Try consulting with your spinal cord... like before, when you pulled those primal dance moves. I'm sure the world was glad to see them again after all that time."

- text: What is all of this? The scent, the sound, the air? This world of matter and its pale antipode. The camera of her mind glides over the surface of the water. There is a term of endearment they coined for it. In the Dolorian century, when humanity was *high* on this world, discovering more and more of it -- these archipelagos included. Elysium. We used to think it was a sphere, but that is beginning to look less and less likely by the day. Between the big three scientific contributors, they're piercing together a dark grey corona. Pale covers 72% of the surface. There are gray flares and prominences, even arcs above entire isolas... The iamges are blurry, but if there was a sphere in there it certainly looks like it fractured a long time ago. They say there is a rarefied envelope of matter surrounding the darkened disc of our planet. Or, to speak more plainly, imagine vast swathes of land disrupted by nothingness. It's like the corwning of the world. It's insane. Very *disco*. You'd love it.

- text: "\"Detective Du Bois...\" He bows lightly. \"It was downright *tragic*. Now let's go\". To him, being a cop in the RCM was truly expressed in that performance."

- text: There it is again -- the scent of apricots, with a touch of cinnamon. Smells like the end of some distant summer. The surface of another planet, or some ancient temple. The sun sets into the sea, but the water does not boil. Instead it turns to liquid gold. For a moment, the world's store of precious metals seems to increase dramatically, and you are rich... Bitter, citrus, sweet, it seems to grow stronger, like a glow, withe very breath you take... until a blossom of skin and flower petals erupts behind your closed eyes. Made of toffee, cream, and distance.

- text: This is a person coming to terms with a new reality. One where they are *wrong*. It's not easy.

- text: One leader and one follower, the most ancient power dynamic.

- text: "Econoclards claim to be communists, but in reality they're just liberals with hard-ons for spreadsheets. The Gottwald school *look* like communists, they *talk* like communists, but scratch the patina and you'll see beneath that they're just depressed liberals who've read too many books.

  \"And what about the liberals? Are they liberals, too?\"
    \"Of course not. The only people who call themselves liberals are mouth-foaming reactionaries.\"
  \"Basically indistinguishable from fascists. You'd need an x-ray machine to tell the difference\""

- text: Lynching? No. We're not an *operational* cell. We think of ourselves as more of an intellectual vanguard.

- text: Are they being sarcastic? You feel like you're caught in some elaborate joke labyrinth, but it's impossible to see your way through. It's always that way. Beneath the crust of irony there's a molten sincerity that threatens to erupt forth... you may witness it yet.

- text: "\"It's heavier than I was expecting.\" The rifle rests in his open palms. Its position reminds you of something... The attitude of a priest bearing one of the holy relics of his faith. Though it is long out-of-service, its power is evident to him."

- text: Soon you're debating whether a de-commodified spirituality is even possible under communism... Probably not, is the answer. Which isn't to say it isn't *sometimes* still useful.

- text: "*This* limbed and headed machine of pain and undignified suffering is grinding to a halt. Tired of walking the desert, it doesn't want to think anymore."

- text: We prefer difficult books. Books that might destroy you, if you don't destroy them first.

- text: "\"What is Oranjese literature about?\"
  \"Fear of failure, fear of death. How it *sucks* to be Oranjese. All national literatures are -- only the name of the nation changes\".
  If that's true, then *Revacholian lit* would fit you like a glove."

- text: "Something is bad in my head. In the past.
  That's where it always comes from, isn't it? From the head -- and from the past."

- text: "\"Yeah, I don't wanna say that shit about him. Tell them it's not my style. They'll have to, you know -- if they want to jazz up the charges -- they'll have to get someone more...\" She searches for the word, then shrugs. \"Rapeable\".
  \"Could that be why they lynched him? Jealousy?\"
\"I hope not\". A pause. \"Actually, I *know* that's not the reason. I'm careful about that kind of thing. Not crossing the wires, you know. But that's probably where they got the rape idea.\"
  \"What do you mean?\"
\"Men like that? I don't know\". Another pause. \"It's the way their imaginations work\". I suspect it's what they'd like to do to me.\"

\"It sounds like something happened and you don't want to acknowledge it.\"
  \"Let me make this 100% clear then, officer. I was not sexually assaulted.\" She tilts her head. \"Would I be as flippant if I had been?\"
Empathy: You get the feeling she might be."

Volition: You too.
Authority: Me? Get outta here, I'm solid.
Volition: These guys are compromised. She's got them singing along to her tune. The little beeps and bloops you trust for info -- you can't trust them anymore. I'm sorry I didn't catch it sooner. It takes conscious effort on your part.

You: Which ones exactly are affected?

Volition: There's no way of knowing. At the moment I'm afraid it's best to assume... *all* of them.
Electrochemistry: Bullshit, man. I ain't *compromised*.
Volition: *Especially* that guy. That guy's the most compromised one in here.
Electrochemistry: No fucking way, man, I just want a drag of that sweet Menthol ziggie.
Volition: Really? Quick, tell me what's under her jumpsuit?
Electrochemistry: GLORY. TRUTH. SOFTNESS. PROTECT HER. SHE WANTS YOU.
Volition: I take it back. He's got it pretty bad, but this *next guy* is on another level entirely...
Suggestion: She likes you. The Crownhead is a boring condom. He's jealous. This is human nature.

You: How did this happen?

Volition: Like it always does -- through subtlety.

You: What Can I do?

Volition: There's nothing you can do about it. You are how you are -- and she is how she is. Things will go as they do.

You: Can't you turn them normal again?

Volition: No.

You: What use is this then?

Volition: It's better to know you are being played than to be played without knowing it, is it not?

You: What is her *plan*.

Volition: You can't draw a sound conclusion. The one who usually does says...
Logic: She may want to control the information rollout -- not to become a suspect. She may have a past she's escaping, unrelated to this case. You doubt it's something truly insidious.
Volition: See? It's oddly moderate. Probably compromised.

You: Does that mean she's been lying to me?

Volition: I think it's safe to assume: yes. Mr. Thesbian here hasn't been speaking up. If he were, I suspect there would be paeans to her truthfulness. Like this...
Drama: She isth a laedy most fair and juste!
Volition: In his defence -- to reduce him to such inadequecy, she probably had to employ half-truths more often than outright lies.
Rhetoric: That is correct. And ommisions too.

You: Can I trust that guy?

Volition: A little. They're all still of limited use, interpreting things to the best of their ability. Maybe they add flair or something? I wouldn't know. I don't add flair. But when it comes to assessments of character, or factual accuracy they are not to be trusted. Not with her.

You: Can I trust any of them *ever* again.

Volition: Don't be melodramatic. You can trust them. Just not with *her*.
Perception: A light green speck, and imperfection, on the outer rim of her right iris. It sparkles...

You: I've been talking to myself long enough. Let's get back to it.

Volition: Don't worry, it's only been four or five seconds. You've got this.

You: \"Miss, are you manipulating me?\"

The silence broken, she exhales a cloud of smoke and says... \"God, no!\"

Later...

\"He told me --- love did him in.\"
  \"That's not funny officer.\"
Composure: Her voice is like a slash through the air. Her shoulders tense up.
Volition: There. She momentarily lost control over Straight-Back-Guy! It appears she feels *guilty*.

Later...

Empathy: You sense a little hesitation there -- or maybe even fear? The stress was on the wrong syllable.

  \"Of the king? Of the nation? Of communism? Return on investment?\" She tilts her head. \"I don't know exactly. It's meant to be vague, as promises generally are. But at the same time, I mean -- things can't go on like this forever. Something will give. It always does.\""

It lifted streets from the ground and turned houses into ghosts. The mask of humanity fall from capital. It has to take it off to kill everyone — everything you love; all the hope and tenderness in the world. It has to take it off, just for one second. To do the deed. And then you see it.
